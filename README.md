# bowling.php
My own implementation of a bowling game in PHP. It's a popular coding kata.

## Driven by TDD
The whole thing ist driven by TDD and continuously integrated at codeship.io.

## How to run?
It's more a library than a whole application yet. 
Run `php run.php` on console to see how it works.
```
$ php run.php
